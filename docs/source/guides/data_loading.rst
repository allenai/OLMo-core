Data loading
============

.. note::
   This guide is specific to text-based data, however the :class:`~olmo_core.train.Trainer` can be
   used with other modalities as well by creating a custom data loader subclass of
   :class:`~olmo_core.data.data_loader.DataLoaderBase`.

Using OLMo-core's builtin data loading
--------------------------------------

Data preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OLMo-core's builtin data loading functionality requires you to pre-tokenize your data into 1D numpy arrays of token IDs. These arrays should include all special tokens already -- such as "end of sentence" (EOS) tokens -- except for padding tokens.

For example::

    import numpy as np

    documents = ["Hello, World!", "The quick brown fox jumped over the fence"]

    # Tokenize documents
    token_ids = []
    for doc in documents:
        token_ids.extend(tokenizer.encode(doc))

    # Write token IDs to disk
    data_mmap = np.memmap("data001.npy", mode="w+", dtype=np.uint32, shape=(len(token_ids),))
    data_mmap[:] = token_ids
    data_mmap.flush()

.. seealso::
    The `dolma <https://github.com/allenai/dolma>`_ project includes an optimized toolkit for pre-processing data into this format.

Train data loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you're data is pre-processed as above there are several different strategies available for loading that data for training.

Concat and chunk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simplest strategy is the "concatenate and chunk" approach, which means all tokenized documents are concatenated together and then chunked into training instances of the desired sequence length.
To use this method you just need to pass a :class:`~olmo_core.data.data_loader.NumpyFSLDataLoader` with a :class:`~olmo_core.data.numpy_dataset.NumpyFSLDataset` to your trainer.

While this strategy is simple and efficient, it does have a couple downsides:

1. Documents often end up fragmented across multiple training instances.
2. Since each training instance may be composed of multiple documents, the model will be attending to tokens across different documents, which could potentially have adverse affects on the model (see `Zhao et al. (2024) <Zhao et al 2024_>`_ for example).

Concat and chunk with intra-document masking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The latter downside can be addressed by using `intra-document masking <intra-document masking_>`_, which you can enable
by setting ``generate_doc_lengths=True`` in your :class:`~olmo_core.data.numpy_dataset.NumpyFSLDataset` and using a model implementation that accepts the parameters ``doc_lens`` and ``max_doc_lens`` to its ``forward()`` method.
See the :class:`~olmo_core.nn.transformer.Transformer` model implementation for example.

Document packing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An alternative to the concatenate and chunk approach that also addresses the issue of document fragmentation is `document packing <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10830>`_,
which uses a bin-packing algorithm to pack documents into instances with minimal padding.
You can enable this strategy by replacing your :class:`~olmo_core.data.numpy_dataset.NumpyFSLDataset` with a :class:`~olmo_core.data.numpy_dataset.NumpyPackedFSLDataset`.

Variable sequence length training
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another alternative is variable sequence length (VSL) training through "dataset decomposition" (`Pouransari et al. (2024) <Pouransari et al 2024_>`_).
With dataset decomposition, every training instance is a unique subset of tokens from a single document. Therefore there's no need for intra-document masking.
You can use this approach by setting a :class:`~olmo_core.data.data_loader.NumpyVSLDataLoader` as your trainer's :data:`~olmo_core.train.Trainer.data_loader`.

This requires you set a ``min_sequence_length`` and ``max_sequence_length`` which must both be powers of 2 (e.g. 256 and 4096). Each training batch will be composed of instances of the same sequence length such that the total number of tokens in the batch is equal to your :data:`~olmo_core.train.Trainer.global_batch_size`.

You can also configure a :class:`~olmo_core.data.numpy_dataset.VSLCurriculum` to control the sampling probability of different sequence lengths over the course of an epoch.

Using a custom data loader
--------------------------

Using a custom data loader with the :class:`~olmo_core.train.Trainer` just requires implementing your own :class:`~olmo_core.data.data_loader.DataLoaderBase` subclass.

In particular you need to take care when implementing the :meth:`~olmo_core.data.data_loader.DataLoaderBase._iter_batches` method to ensure each batch returned only contains the rank's local portion of the batch (with exactly :data:`~olmo_core.data.data_loader.DataLoaderBase.rank_batch_size` tokens).
You should also implement :meth:`~olmo_core.data.data_loader.DataLoaderBase.state_dict()` and :meth:`~olmo_core.data.data_loader.DataLoaderBase.load_state_dict()` such that your data loader will pick up where it left off in an epoch after :meth:`~olmo_core.data.data_loader.DataLoaderBase.load_state_dict()` is called.

For a real-world example see the source code of :class:`~olmo_core.data.data_loader.NumpyDataLoaderBase`.
But for simplicity here's a toy example that just generates random token IDs.
