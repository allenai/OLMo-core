Train a Llama model
===================

The following snippets can be found in `src/examples/llama/ <https://github.com/allenai/OLMo-core/tree/main/src/examples/llama>`_.
The ``train.py`` script is meant to be launched via ``torchrun``.
You can also use the `python -m olmo_core.launch.beaker` CLI to quickly launch this script on Beaker.
