"""Point/grounding formatting for Molmo2 pointing & counting data.

Dependency-free port of the single-image path of ``mm_olmo``'s
``GroundingPreprocessor`` (``olmo/models/molmo2/grounding_formatter.py``, the
``html-v2`` format used by stage-1) plus the pointing / counting answer assembly
(``get_point_string`` in ``olmo/data/data_formatter.py``).

A set of points for one image is rendered as::

    <points coords="1 1 XXX YYY 2 XXX YYY ...">label</points>

where the leading ``1`` is the (single) image index, then ``PTID X Y`` per point,
with X/Y scaled to 0-1000 (3-digit, zero-padded) and points sorted by (x, y).
