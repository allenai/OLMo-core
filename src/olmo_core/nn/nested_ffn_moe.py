"""
Nested-width FFN mixture ("flexible-compute FFN", learned router).

The role-gated FFN (:mod:`olmo_core.nn.role_gated_ffn`) gives every context-document token the
same binary choice -- full MLP or nothing -- from a deterministic role rule. That failed: gating
from layer 4 could not fit the training data at all (CE wall 0.95) and gating from layer 12 fit
but evaluated at 0.316. Doc tokens need *some* MLP compute, and a role-blind all-or-nothing rule
cannot allocate it.

This module replaces the binary choice with a **ladder of nested widths** plus a learned per-token
router. Each block's FFN exposes several granularities that share one set of weights by prefix-
slicing the hidden dimension::

    rung 0: y = w2[:, :9728] (act(w1[:9728] x) * w3[:9728] x)   cost 1.0    (the original FFN)
    rung 1: y = w2[:, :2432] (act(w1[:2432] x) * w3[:2432] x)   cost 1/4
    rung 2: ... 608 units                                        cost 1/16
    rung 3: ... 152 units                                        cost 1/64
    rung 4: y = 0                                                cost 0      (null / AdaMoE)

A per-layer linear router scores the rungs from the token's hidden state; the token runs on
exactly ONE rung, chosen by argmax. Tokens are grouped by rung and each group runs a narrow
matmul, so the saving is a genuinely smaller GEMM, not a masked multiply.

Relation to the literature
--------------------------
- **AdaMoE** (Zeng et al. 2024) contributes the *null expert* -- a zero-output, zero-FLOP entry in
  the routing pool -- and the idea of decoupling load balancing from a budget term that dials
  average compute. But its experts are all the SAME size, so its dynamic range is the top-k value
  (~14% FLOP savings on Mixtral), and it presupposes an existing MoE. Qwen3-4B is dense.
- **MatFormer** (Devvrit et al. 2023) contributes nested prefix-sliced FFN granularities sharing
  one weight matrix -- but chooses a granularity per *deployment*, not per token.
- **MoNE** (Jain et al. 2024) is the routed version of nesting under a compute budget; this module
  is closest to it.
- **Mixture-of-Depths** (Raposo et al. 2024) contributes the static-shape capacity trick.

The synthesis here is: nested widths (MatFormer/MoNE geometry) + a null rung (AdaMoE) + a budget
hinge loss. Crucially it adds NO expert parameters -- only a tiny router and per-rung gains -- so
it can be fitted onto an already-trained checkpoint (e.g. the v25 pooled-doc-KV model) instead of
requiring a fresh pretrain.

Why it should not repeat the v24/v26 failure
--------------------------------------------
1. The bottom rung is not the only cheap option: a token that needs a little MLP can take 1/64
   instead of being forced to choose between full and zero.
2. The router is **zero-initialized to pick the full rung with probability ~1**, so at step 0 the
   model is bit-identical to its base. Compute is given up only as the budget loss pushes it.
3. The budget term is a **hinge on the batch mean**, not a per-token pull toward zero, so the
   model is free to spend full compute on a few tokens and nothing on the rest -- which is the
   whole point. Below the target the term is exactly 0 and only CE is optimized.

Objective
---------
``loss = CE + lambda_budget * relu(mean_cost - target)**p
             + w_recon * relative_mse(chosen_rung_output, full_ffn_output)   [optional]
             - w_entropy * router_entropy                                    [optional]``

``mean_cost`` is the router-probability-weighted expected cost averaged over tokens and gated
layers (differentiable in the router). The optional reconstruction term is a *local* distillation
of the full FFN by the small rungs, measured on a small random subset of tokens (default 2%), and
is the literal form of "keep the output similar to the original with the smallest FFN". It runs
only the FFN on that subset -- it involves no attention and no full-context forward, so it is
outside the no-full-attention-at-32k constraint.

Parameter baking
----------------
The router and gain parameters are new state-dict keys, so a base checkpoint must be re-saved with
them present before training (distributed-checkpoint loads are driven by the destination model's
keys). Use ``src/scripts/train/memexpress/ffnmoe/bake_ffn_moe_into_base.py``, exactly as the
soft-token projector is baked by ``bake_projector_into_base.py``.

    .. note::
        Under activation checkpointing every routed block's forward runs twice (once in forward,
        once in the backward recompute), so :meth:`accumulate` is called twice per block. Both the
        cost sum and the token count double, so every quantity :meth:`metrics` reports -- all of
        which are ratios -- is unaffected. The duplicate loss tensors appended during recompute
        are never read: the regularization loss is built during the forward and the accumulators
        are cleared by the next :meth:`begin_forward`.

    :param target_cost: Budget target -- the mean per-token FFN cost the hinge allows for free.

    :param hinge_power: 1 for a linear hinge (constant pressure above target), 2 for squared.
    :param two_sided: Penalize ``|mean_cost - target|`` instead of the one-sided hinge, so the
        router is pulled back UP when it undershoots the budget. With the one-sided hinge the
        only routing pressure is downward: on a 30-step long-context SFT (fs35 nq 16M) the
        mean cost sank to 0.0026 against a 0.01 target, half the tokens in the routed layers
        got no FFN at all, and the 32k rung collapsed (f1 0.14 vs 0.76 dense). Two-sided keeps
        the realized cost AT the target, which is also what makes the FLOP accounting exact.
    :param target_start: Target at call 0; annealed linearly to ``target_cost`` over
        ``target_anneal_calls`` forwards. Starting at 1.0 means no compute pressure at all until

    :param target_anneal_calls: Length of that anneal, in forward calls (0 disables).
    :param explore_prob: Probability that a *training* token ignores the argmax and takes a
        uniformly random rung. Gives the small rungs gradient before the router ever prefers them
        (the nesting chicken-and-egg). Annealed to 0 over ``explore_anneal_calls``.
